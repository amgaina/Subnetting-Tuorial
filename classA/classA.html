                Since it is a class A network, default subnet mask will be 255.0.0.0.<br>

                Each subnet mask is a sequence of contiguous 1s followed by zeros in a 32-bit binary representation.<br>
                The CIDR notation is expressed as "/X," where X is the number of bits set to 1 in the subnet mask.<br>
                For example:<br>
                CIDR Notation: /11<br>
                Subnet Mask: 11111111.11100000.00000000.00000000 (255.224.0.0 in decimal)<br>
                In this case, there are 11 bits set to 1, so the CIDR notation is "/11."
