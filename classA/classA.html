                Each subnet mask is a sequence of contiguous number of 1 bits followed by some number of 0 bits in a 32-bit binary representation.<br>
                The CIDR notation is expressed as "/X," where X is the number of bits set to 1 in the subnet mask.<br>
                For example:<br>
                CIDR Notation: /11<br>
                Subnet Mask IP address: 11111111.11100000.00000000.00000000 (255.224.0.0 in decimal)<br>
                In this case, there are 11 bits set to 1, so the CIDR notation is "/11."

                First, convert both the computer's IP address and subnet mask IP address to their binary forms. <br>
                Second, perform a bitwise AND operation between binary representation of the computer's IP address and the binary representation of the subnet mask IP address.<br>
                Third, convert the result of the AND operation back to decimal to obtain the network IP address in dotted-qad form.<br>
                For example: <br>
                Computer's IP address: 32.145.1.35 <br>
                Subnet Mask IP address: 255.248.0.0<br>
                Computer's IP address(32.145.1.35) in binary: 00100000.10010001.00000001.00100011<br>

                Result of AND operation: 00100000.10010000.00000000.00000000 <br>

                Number of usable host IP addresses will be 2<sup>(32 - CIDR number)</sup> - 2.<br>
                We subtract two for the network and broadcast IP addresses.<br>
                For example: <br>
                If CIDR number is /14 <br>
