                Each subnet mask is a sequence of contiguous number of 1 bits followed by some number of 0 bits in a 32-bit binary representation.<br>
                The CIDR notation is expressed as "/X," where X is the number of bits set to 1 in the subnet mask.<br>
                For example:<br>
                CIDR Notation: /27<br>
                Subnet Mask IP address: 11111111.11111111.11111111.11100000 (255.255.255.224 in decimal)<br>
                In this case, there are 27 contiguous bits set to 1, so the CIDR notation is "/27."

                First, convert both the computer's IP address and subnet mask IP address to the binary forms. <br>
                Second, perform bitwise AND operation between binary representation of the computer's IP address and the binary representation of the subnet mask IP address.<br>
                Third, convert the result of the AND operation back to decimal to obtain the network IP address in a dotted-qad form.<br>
                For example: <br>
                Computer's IP address: 192.168.1.35 <br>
                Subnet Mask IP address: 255.255.255.192<br>
                Computer's IP Address(192.168.1.35) in binary: 11000000.10101000.00000001.00100011<br>

                Result of AND operation: 11000000.10101000.00000001.00000000 <br>
