                Each subnet mask is a sequence of contiguous 1s followed by contiguous zeros in a 32-bit binary representation.<br>
                The CIDR notation is expressed as "/X," where X is the number of bits set to 1 in the subnet mask.<br>
                For example:<br>
                CIDR Notation: /27<br>
                Subnet Mask: 11111111.11111111.11111111.11100000 (255.255.255.224 in decimal)<br>
                In this case, there are 27 contiguous bits set to 1, so the CIDR notation is "/27."

                Third, convert the result of the AND operation back to decimal to obtain the network address.<br>
